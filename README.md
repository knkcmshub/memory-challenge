# Introduction memory-challenge
Create a simple and easy to use memory game.
The game should be played in a single browser window. We don't need to implement a memory game server.
We don't need to impplement pretty pictures for the cards. You just can use colors instead of pictures.

## Key Features 
- [ ] Setup game
  - [ ] Number of cards to play with
  - [ ] Number of players
- [ ] Game: Flip charts. If two cards match, the player can try antoher match otherwise the next player gets the chance.
- [ ] Scoring system
  - [ ] Implement a timer how long the games takes
  - [ ] Count the matching cards for each player
- [ ] Show the game result at the end of each game

## Bonus 
Feel free to use all tools and framework you are already familiar with.

- ReactJS
- TypeScript
- [Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/)
